# Java-TP-Link-smart-plugs 
This codes does the same thing as the python script [HERE](https://github.com/BenJeau/arduino-tp-link-smart-plugs), but the process is more automated, since the only step for you to make to connect to the smart plugs is to provide your Kasa credentials. From there, you can see every device you have, toggle them and refresh their status. I've decided to have a Java version of this since I'm in the process of making an Android application and later on (soon), I'll convert that application to a Wear OS application.
